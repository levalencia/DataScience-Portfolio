    "# Creating a Langchain application with Streamlit, OpenAI to talk to your own text documents using Pinecone as Vector DB\n",
    "\n",
    "## Some basic concepts and terminology \n",
    "\n",
    "### Langchain\n",
    "\n",
    "LangLangChain is a framework designed to simplify the creation of applications using large language models (LLMs). It is used for chatbots, document analysis and summarization, code analysis and more . LangChain provides a framework for connecting LLMs to other sources of data such as the internet or personal files. This allows developers to chain together multiple commands to create more complex applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Streamlit\n",
    "\n",
    "Streamlit its just a framework which allows to easily create UX to text your Python Apps, no more console apps!.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Vector Database\n",
    "\n",
    "A vector database is a type of database that stores data as high-dimensional vectors, which are mathematical representations of features or attributes. Each vector has a certain number of dimensions, which can range from tens to thousands, depending on the complexity and granularity of the data. Vector databases are purpose-built databases that are specialized to tackle the problems that arise when managing vector embeddings in production scenarios. For that reason, they offer significant advantages over traditional scalar-based databases and standalone vector indexes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### OpenAI\n",
    "\n",
    "OpenAI is an AI research and deployment company. Their mission is to ensure that artificial general intelligence benefits all of humanity. OpenAI conducts AI research with the declared intention of promoting and developing a friendly AI. They have developed several models such as GPT-4 which can solve difficult problems with greater accuracy, thanks to its broader general knowledge and problem-solving abilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Context\n",
    "\n",
    "Basically what our customer (Acme Corp) wants to achieve its to be able to chat with their own documents, be able to ask plan english questions and get a response back nicely formatted.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this we are going to create a simple app with the following functionalities:\n",
    "1.  Create a PineCone Index.\n",
    "2.  Add free text and index it into the PineCone Index, basically its converting from text to vectors.\n",
    "3.  Create a user interface to be able to chat with this index.\n",
    "    - For the user interface we will use Streamlit for testing.\n",
    "    - We will use open AI to instantiate an Open AI LLM.\n",
    "    - We will use langchain to prove its benefits when developing LLM Apps, Langchain will also use an LLM to format the questions as embeddings and the responses as plain english.\n",
    "    - We will use PineCone SDK to get results from the the vector db.\n",
