In a quiet village nestled between the mountains and the sea, the people lived peacefully for generations. The air was crisp, the waters clear, and time seemed to slow down as one strolled through the cobblestone streets. Every morning, the bakery on the corner would fill the air with the scent of fresh bread, luring both locals and visitors alike.

However, not all was as it seemed. Beneath this peaceful exterior, a series of strange occurrences began to unsettle the villagers. First, the livestock started to vanish without a trace. Then, strange symbols were found etched into the walls of old buildings. At night, the sound of distant wailing could be heard echoing from the forest.

The townsfolk were baffled. Some claimed it was the work of ancient spirits, others whispered about a secret cult that had taken root nearby. Despite the growing tension, life went on. Children still played in the streets, merchants set up their stalls, and fishermen cast their nets into the sea.

One day, a stranger arrived at the village. He was tall, with piercing blue eyes and a scar that ran from his cheek to his chin. He spoke little, but his presence was commanding. Rumors spread quickly about who he was. Some said he was a traveler from a distant land, others believed he was a soldier on the run. Whatever the case, his arrival coincided with an escalation of the strange events.

That night, as the moon hung full and low in the sky, the village was shaken by an earthquake. It wasn’t strong enough to cause serious damage, but it was enough to wake everyone from their beds. The stranger, however, was nowhere to be found. Search parties were formed, but they yielded no results. The forest loomed large and foreboding on the outskirts, and few dared to venture too deep into its shadows.

Weeks passed, and the unease only grew. The villagers began to lose hope, some fleeing to neighboring towns in search of safety. Yet, others remained, determined to uncover the truth. It was during this time that an old woman, one of the village elders, began to tell stories of a hidden power buried deep within the land. "It’s not just the forest," she whispered, her voice trembling with age, "there are forces here older than time itself."

Curiosity led a small group of villagers to investigate the old woman’s claims. They gathered supplies and set off into the woods. The deeper they went, the more they felt a strange energy in the air. It was as if the forest was alive, watching them, waiting. Eventually, they came upon a clearing. In the center stood a large stone, covered in the same symbols that had appeared in the village. But before they could investigate further, a thick mist rolled in, obscuring their view and silencing the world around them.

Suddenly, they heard a voice. It wasn’t loud, but it echoed in their minds as if it had always been there. “You shouldn’t have come,” it said.
