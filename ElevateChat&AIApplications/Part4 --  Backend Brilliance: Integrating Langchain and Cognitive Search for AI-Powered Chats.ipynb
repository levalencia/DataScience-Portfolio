    "### Understanding the Scenario\n",
    "In today's data-driven world, efficient document indexing and retrieval are crucial for businesses to extract valuable insights from their data. Azure Cognitive Search offers a robust platform for creating and managing search indexes, allowing organizations to build intuitive and effective search experiences for their users. However, the process of indexing large volumes of data and retrieving relevant information can be complex and resource-intensive.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address these challenges, we'll explore a scenario where Azure Functions play a pivotal role in automating and enhancing the document indexing and retrieval process. By integrating Azure Cognitive Search with custom language models and external APIs, we can create a streamlined workflow that optimizes the search experience and improves data accessibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Setting Up the Environment\n",
    "Before we dive into the code, let's ensure we have the necessary tools and services set up to replicate this solution. In this scenario, we'll need:\n",
    "\n",
    "- An Azure subscription with access to Azure Cognitive Search.\n",
    "- Azure Functions runtime environment.\n",
    "- OpenAI API credentials for language modeling.\n",
    "- A storage account for storing documents and metadata.\n",
    "- Python development environment with required libraries and packages."

    "### Key Components Explained\n",
    "To implement our solution, we'll leverage several custom modules and libraries:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **chunkindexmanager:** A module responsible for creating chunk-based search indexes in Azure Cognitive Search. It uses specialized algorithms for efficient indexing and retrieval of large documents. Explained in previous part.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **documentindexmanager:** This module handles the creation and management of document-based search indexes. It also interacts with storage accounts to retrieve document data.  Explained in previous part.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **langchain:** A library that integrates custom language models for intelligent document retrieval. It combines the power of language understanding with retrieval techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **AzureChatOpenAI:** A class from the langchain library that interacts with OpenAI's language models to generate human-like responses to user queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **AzureCognitiveSearchRetriever:** A retriever class from the langchain library that interacts with Azure Cognitive Search to retrieve relevant documents based on user queries.\n",
